# n-queens
The classic problem of placing "queen" chess pieces on an NÃ—N board such that no queen attacks any other queen.  Queen pieces move vertically, horizontally, and both diagonals.  This repo implements search algorithms to solve this problem in both C++ and Python programming languages.

- C++
    - Depth First Search
    - Greedy Local Search
    - Genetic Search
    - Simulated Annealing (under RESEARCH)


- Python  
    - Depth First Search
    - Greedy Local Search
    - Genetic Search (under development)

## C++
Currently, genetic search performs slower than both depth first and greedy local search algorithms.

#### Building:
the usual:  `make`

#### Usage:
`./n-queens <seed> <N>`, where seed is used to seed the random generator, and N is used to specify the board size.


## Python:
Currently, no main driver exists for Python classes.  A module will be created in the future with a driver script.

#### Usage:
`python3 depth_first.py`  
`python3 greedy_local.py`
